# GlobalTicketHub

System Development: Designed and implemented a comprehensive transport system enabling users to seamlessly order tickets for buses, trains, and planes.

Database Management: Created and managed a custom database using MSSQL due to the unavailability of existing APIs, ensuring robust and scalable data storage and retrieval.

Software Architecture: Employed a structured approach by implementing a multi-layered architecture, including Domain, Data Logic Layer (DLL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Presentation Layer, to ensure modularity and maintainability.

API Integration: Facilitated smooth communication between the backend and frontend by developing an ASP.NET Web API, delivering a reliable and efficient user experience.
